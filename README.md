## Description

-   The mission of this project was to develop a search algorithm to filter and display dynamically a list of recipes with two copenents : the main search bar and the filter options. To how It works, I made a detaled document about It's structure and the choices made during it's development : ([EN](https://github.com/leoncik/LeonardWojcik_7_05022022/files/8379956/Fiche.investigation.algorithme.-.EN.pdf) / [FR](https://github.com/leoncik/LeonardWojcik_7_05022022/files/8379960/Fiche.investigation.algorithme.-.FR.pdf)).
